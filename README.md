# Zkt-Eco-Net-Driver
A driver for ZKT Eco device on TCP/IP enabled networks using the C/C++ programming language (The only one that exists on the net free of charge as far as am concerned, there are others but are not written using C/C++ from scratch like this dude here). This module partially implements the most basic functionalities of ZKT Eco such as fetching of user info and attendance data in real time. However the functionalities in this module have been intentionally left somewhat incomplete while somewhat demonestrating the basic functionalities. For example; the hashing algorithim for password set devices has not been implemented because we never needed it since the devices were not password restricted.
Also, extra-work is required to convert this into a full-fledged library that can be used from any programming language; this one was used as is on a C/C++ implementation so no further modfication was required.
